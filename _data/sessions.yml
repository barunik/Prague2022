  title: "Currency Network Risk"
  description: "Authors: Mykola Babiak and Jozef Barunik<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  This paper identifies new currency risk stemming from a network of idiosyncratic option-based currency volatilities and shows how such network risk is priced in the cross-section of currency returns. A portfolio that buys net-receivers and sells net-transmitters of short-term linkages between currency volatilities generates a significant Sharpe ratio. The network strategy formed on causal connections is uncorrelated with popular benchmarks and generates a significant alpha, while network returns formed on aggregate connections, which are driven by a strong correlation component, are partially subsumed by standard factors. Long-term linkages are priced less, indicating a downward-sloping term structure of network risk. </p>"

  title: "Structural Deep Learning in Conditional Asset Pricing"
  description: "Authors: Jianqing Fan, Tracy Ke, Yuan Liao, and Andreas Neuhierl<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  We develop new financial economics theory guided structural nonparametric methods
  for estimating conditional asset pricing models using deep neural networks, by employing
  time-varying conditional information on alphas and betas carried by firm-specific characteristics.
  Contrary to many applications of neural networks in economics, we can open the black box
  of machine learning predictions by incorporating financial economics theory into the learning,
  and provide an economic interpretation of the successful predictions obtained from neural networks,
  by decomposing the neural predictors as risk-related and mispricing components. Our estimation
  method starts with period-by-period  cross-sectional deep learning, followed by local PCAs to
  capture time-varying features such as latent factors of the model.  We formally establish the
  asymptotic theory of the structural deep-learning estimators, which apply to both in-sample
  fit and out-of-sample predictions. We also illustrate the double-descent-risk phenomena
  associated with over-parametrized predictions, which justifies the use of over-fitting machine
  learning methods.</p>"

  title: "Modelling news-based uncertainty and its impact on the volatility feedback effect"
  description: "Authors: Cathy Yi-Hsuan Chen, Jozef Barunik and Ankush Agarwal<br/>
  <p>Abstract: We consider a general framework that allows the coexistence of a stochastic volatility
  factor and a stochastic uncertainty factor. Motivated by the stylised facts of the volatility and
  uncertainty factor including mean reversion, leverage effect, and clustering, we characterise these
  two processes as the  CIR-type process and model their interplay with the (log) price process.
We introduce a novel ``bottom-up'' uncertainty measure based on cross-sectional dispersion of firm-level
news-based sentiment score. We also consider a ``top-down'' measure, the economic policy uncertainty (EPU)
of Baker et al (2016). Compared to the volatility process, the uncertainty process exhibits a prompt
mean reversion and a modest feedback effect on the price process. We obtain a positive feedback effect
from both volatility and uncertainty factors. It is worth noting that like the volatility factor the
uncertainty factor exhibits a ``continuous-time'' leverage effect albeit less prominent. Concerning the
correlated Brownian motions in the system, we derive the desired propositions for the volatility feedback
w.r.t the two risk factors and correct the potential biases in the population regression. Using the NASDAQ
news for the construction of an uncertainty measure, we calibrate the model parameters and conclude that
given a salient correlated Brownian motion between the price and volatility process, the population
feedback coefficient corresponding to the volatility factor is more significant than the uncertainty factor.
The results are robust for the considered uncertainty measures.  </p>"

  title: "Evolution of Hybrid Models Combining Exponential Smoothing and Recurrent Neural Networks
for Forecasting Time Series with Complex Seasonality"
  description: "Authors: Grzegorz Dudek, Slawek Smyl, Pawel Pelka <br/>
  <p>Abstract:  Forecasting time series with multiple seasonal periods is a challenging problem due to the complicated
  relationship between input and output data. To solve this problem, a forecasting model should be equipped with
  appropriate mechanisms to deal with short- and long-term dynamics as well as a trend and variable variance.
  In this study, we show an evolution of the hybrid and hierarchical models we have developed recently for
  forecasting time series with complex seasonal pattern. The models are derived from the winning submission
  to the M4 forecasting competition and produce point forecasts as well as predictive intervals. They combine
  exponential smoothing (ES) and gated recurrent neural networks (RNN) in a hierarchical architecture composed
  of a global part trained across many time series (cross-learning) and a time series specific part. ES extracts
  dynamically the main components of each individual series and enables the model to learn their representation.
  A multi-layer RNN is equipped with dilated recurrent cells designed to efficiently model short-term, long-term
  and seasonal dependencies in time series. The most advanced models are based on a new attentive dilated recurrent
  cell, which implements an attention mechanism for dynamic weighting of input vector components. To improve the internal
  series representation, RNN learns simultaneously both the ES parameters and the main mapping function transforming
  inputs into forecasts. Our most recent solution is a contextually enhanced model which extends per-series input data
  with information contained in the context series (representative series) and thus supports forecasting individual series.
  We evaluate the models on the hourly electricity demand forecasting for 35 European countries. The results demonstrate
  that our models outperform both statistical and state-of-the-art machine learning models in terms of accuracy.</p>"

  <p>Abstract:  Monetary policy shocks are known to affect financial markets. However, it is less clear how a monetary
  policy shock can affect their network structure. We estimate daily total connectedness and net connectedness for 10 industry
  portfolio indices based on intraday data. Using event-based regressions, we show that total connectedness is positively
  influenced by surprise changes in the interest rates. Net connectedness of some industry indices is also influenced,
  some in a positive, while others in a negative direction, revealing how monetary policy shocks propagate through the
  stock market network at a high-frequency level. The results point to the sectoral differences in the propagation of the
  monetary policy shocks.</p>"

Entropy, Optimality of Static Portfolios, Bayesian Markets "
    description: "Authors:  Jan Vecer<br/>
    <p>Abstract: Utility maximization depends on the choice of the underlying riskless
asset as a numeraire. We show that the only numeraire invariant utility
is a logarithmic function. We also note that the prices can be expressed
as the likelihood ratio of the respective state price densities. On the
other side, each state price density generates an asset that corresponds
to the log utility optimal portfolio with respect to all assets. We show
that the expected log return of the price is a relative entropy between
the state price densities. When the market agent that maximizes log
utility uses a mixture distribution of the state price densities of the
market assets, the resulting optimal portfolio is static. When the
market agent uses a prior distribution for her market opinion
distribution, the resulting wealth of each parameter updates in a
Bayesian fashion. </p>"

    <p>Abstract:   Originating from cooperative game theory, Shapley values have become one of the most widely used measures for variable importance in applied Machine Learning. However, the statistical understanding of Shapley values is still limited. In this paper we take a nonparametric (or smoothing) perspective by proposing Shapley curves as a local measure for variable importance. We propose two estimation strategies and derive the consistency and asymptotic normality both under independence and dependence among the features. This allows us to construct confidence intervals in order to conduct inference on the estimated Shapley curves. In an empirical application, we analyze the attributes which drive the prices of cars. </p>"

We show that shocks to such non-linear common movements in the panel of firm’s idiosyncratic quantiles are priced in the cross-section of the US stock returns. Such risk premium is not subsumed by the common volatility, tail beta, downside beta, as well as other popular risk factors. Stocks with high loadings on past quantile risk in the left tail earn up to an annual five-factor alpha 7.4% higher than stocks with low tail risk loadings. Further, we show that quantile factors have predictive power for aggregate market returns.  </p>"

  title: "Robo-advising under rare disasters: inferring an investor's risk aversion"
  description: "Authors: Jiawen Liang<br/>
  <p>Abstract:   We develop a novel framework to learn investors' risk preferences with low-resolution data. Low resolution arises from a short trajectory that records investors' portfolio choices, especially in the presence of disasters. More importantly, the observed portfolio choice is contaminated by behavior bias.
We start with an inverse optimization to minimise biases and infer risk aversion. We propose an algorithm that incorporates the smoothed bootstrap to inverse optimization. The smoothed bootstrap helps oversample the required data from the kernel distribution, so as to support the inference of risk aversion under disasters. Additionally, we regularize the dimension of the estimated risk aversion by the Lasso shrinkage technique. We show that the algorithm's risk aversion asymptotically converges to the true risk aversion. Based on the learned risk aversion, we adopt reinforcement learning to find the optimal investment strategies. Finally, using real data, we demonstrate that Robo-advisors adopting our approach best act on behalf of investors and mitigate the potential behavior bias. </p>"
