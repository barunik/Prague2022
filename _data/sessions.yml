  title: "Currency Network Risk"
  description: "Authors: Mykola Babiak and Jozef Barunik<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  This paper identifies new currency risk stemming from a network of idiosyncratic option-based currency volatilities and shows how such network risk is priced in the cross-section of currency returns. A portfolio that buys net-receivers and sells net-transmitters of short-term linkages between currency volatilities generates a significant Sharpe ratio. The network strategy formed on causal connections is uncorrelated with popular benchmarks and generates a significant alpha, while network returns formed on aggregate connections, which are driven by a strong correlation component, are partially subsumed by standard factors. Long-term linkages are priced less, indicating a downward-sloping term structure of network risk. </p>"

  title: "Structural Deep Learning in Conditional Asset Pricing"
  description: "Authors: Jianqing Fan, Tracy Ke, Yuan Liao, and Andreas Neuhierl<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  We develop new financial economics theory guided structural nonparametric methods for estimating conditional asset pricing models using deep neural networks, by employing time-varying conditional information on alphas and betas carried by firm-specific characteristics. Contrary to many applications of neural networks in economics, we can open the “black box” of machine learning predictions by incorporating financial economics theory into the learning, and provide an economic interpretation of the successful  predictions obtained from neural networks,  by decomposing the neural predictors as risk-related and mispricing components. Our estimation method starts with period-by-period  cross-sectional deep learning, followed by local PCAs to capture time-varying features such as latent factors of the model.  We formally establish the asymptotic theory of the structural deep-learning estimators, which apply to both in-sample fit and out-of-sample predictions. We also illustrate the “double-descent-risk” phenomena associated with over-parametrized predictions, which justifies the use of over-fitting machine learning methods.</p>"

  title: "Metropolis-Hastings via Classification"
  description: "Authors: Jianqing Fan<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  This paper develops a Bayesian computational platform at the interface between posterior sampling and optimization in models whose marginal likelihoods are difficult to evaluate. Inspired by contrastive learning and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), we reframe the likelihood function estimation problem as a classification problem. Pitting a Generator, who simulates fake data, against a Classifier, who tries to distinguish them from the real data, one obtains likelihood (ratio) estimators which can be plugged into the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The resulting Markov chains generate, at a steady state, samples from an approximate posterior whose asymptotic properties we characterize. Drawing upon connections with empirical Bayes and Bayesian mis-specification, we quantify the convergence rate in terms of the contraction speed of the actual posterior and the convergence rate of the Classifier. Asymptotic normality results are also provided which justify the inferential potential of our approach. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach on examples which have challenged for existing Bayesian likelihood-free approaches.</p>"
