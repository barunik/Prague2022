  title: "Beta sorted portfolio"
  description: "Authors: Weining Wang, Matias Canttano, and Richard Crump <br/>
  <p>Abstract:  Portfolio sorting is popular in the empirical finance literature,
where it has been widely used to identify pricing anomalies. Beta sorting is
in particular important as investors typically bid up assets according to betas. We investigate the
statistical properties of a beta sorting procedure by casting
 a two-step nonparametric estimator.  The first step mimics a moving window fit of time-varying betas, and the second
step resembles a portfolio sorting by a partition estimator.
Working with conditional betas, we present valid uniform asymptotic inference
methods.
To illustrate the relevance of our results, we revisit the size and momentum
anomalies.</p>"
